                  To identify the undamped natural frequency and the corresponding damping ratio, you will
                  load the structure with a periodic load at a given frequency, measure the response at one point
                  only (if you are interested, see Appendix A for a demonstration of why this is the case) and
                  repeat this for a set of frequencies close to the undamped natural frequency you are trying
                  to determine.The set of frequencies and associated load amplitude factors suggested for the
                  first mode are summarised in Table 2.2. The frequencies in this table were collected so that
                  each frequency is close to the corresponding undamped frequency, and the amplitude factors
                  were determined so that the magnitude of the reading (voltage) is large enough to minimise
                  the effects of noise while not causing saturation. The load amplitude factor was kept constant
                  for each mode; this is so that we do not rely on assuming linearity of the load with voltage –
                  we recommend you do the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is possible that the undamped natural frequency measured changes from year to year, or
                  even from day to day. This could for instance be due to the experimental setup being moved
                  in the workshop, to the temperature changing from one group session to the other, etc. Some
                  factors will affect the actual natural frequencies, and others may simply affect the experimental
                  errors in the measurement. The implication is that the values in Table 2.2 may need fine-tuning.
                  You need to verify that you do not get any saturation of the signal (the maximum is 10 V,
                  so if you get a reading of 10 V, probably the signal is saturated and you need to repeat the
                  measurement with a slightly lower amplification factor). In addition, you need to verify that
                  you get a reasonable number of points on either side of the undamped natural frequency (if all measurements are below or above the natural frequency [which you can know by paying
                  attention to the magnitudes of the accelerations as you collect the data], then you need to do
                  some further measurements).

                    Before the lab, you can prepare in your log book (or laptop, or tablet, etc) a table with
                    four columns: ‘applied frequency (Hz)’, ‘applied amplitude factor (V)’, ‘read magnitude (V)’,
                    ‘read phase (rad)’, and ‘notes’. You can fill in the columns for ‘applied frequency’ and ‘applied
                    amplification factor’ before the lab; if these need adjustments during the lab, you can then
                    update them. During the lab, for each reading, write down the magnitude of the response
                    and the phase you read. It is also a good idea to take a picture of the computer screen as a
                    precaution. In addition, for each reading, use the ‘notes’ column to write down any observations
                    that may be relevant for that particular measurement (did you see the support frame vibrating?
                    did something else happen that could eventually have affected the reading?). You will appreciate
                    the ‘notes’ column when you later try to interpret your data. During the lab, if you can bring
                    a laptop and process the data in real time, it will give you an advantage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can imagine the acceleration as a rotating vector. For each frequency $w$ you apply, the amplitude and phase you read correspond to the magnitude of this acceleration $||\ddot r||$ of this acceleration vector and its phase $\theta_\ddot r$ with respect to the load. From these, you can find the amplitude and phases for the velocity and displacement using (if you are interested, see Appendix B or the respective video in Blackboard for a full derivation):
                    $$ \left\{
                      \begin{array}{ll}
                      ||\dot r ||= \frac{||\ddot r ||}{w} \\
                      \theta_\dot r = \theta_\ddot r + \frac{\pi}{2} \\
                      \end{array}
                      \right. $$

                      $$ \left\{
                        \begin{array}{ll}
                        ||r ||= \frac{||\dot r ||}{w} \\
                        \theta_r = \theta_\dot r + \frac{\pi}{2} \\
                        \end{array}
                        \right. $$

                        Once you have measured your data, you can find in Blackboard a spreadsheet where you can conveniently paste
                        your data, as well as a video showing you how to use the spreadsheet. However, you can also for instance implement
                        the relevant equations in Matlab and generate your own graphs.
                        $$ $$
                        To calculate the undamped natural frequency $w_u$ and the damping ratio $\xi$, you can (in
                        theory) pick any two frequencies $w_A$ and $w_B$, and then use the phase angle for the velocity at
                        those frequencies ($\theta_{\dot r_A}$  and $\theta_{\dot r_B}$ respectively):
                        $$ {w_u}^2 =\frac{{w_A}^2 w_B \tan \left (\theta _{\dot r _B}  \right) - {w_B}^2 w_A \tan \left (\theta _{\dot r _A}  \right)}{w_B \tan \left (\theta _{\dot r _B}  \right) - w_A \tan \left (\theta _{\dot r _A}  \right)} $$
                        $$ \xi=\frac{1}{2w_u} \cdot \frac{{w_B}^2-{w_A}^2}{w_B \tan \left (\theta _{\dot r _B}  \right) - w_A \tan \left (\theta _{\dot r _A}  \right)}$$
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        If you are interested, see Appendix B or the respective video in Blackboard for a full derivation
                        of Equations 2.2 and 2.3. In practice, not all pairs of points $w_A$ and $w_B$ are equally good.
                        Ideally, you want to pick two frequencies $w_A$ and $w_B$ that are as close as possible to the desired
                        natural frequency $w_u$. These are easy to identify as they correspond to the vicinity of the larger
                        magnitudes (of acceleration) measured.
                        The spreadsheet mentioned before contains those equations already (you may need to adjust
                        the range of various equations and also to select the points A and B that are better suited
                        depending on your data). You can also compare your results to the numerical data in Table D.1
                        and to any other reference experimental data for this setup you can find.
